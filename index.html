    <h1>Archer Discord Bot Changelog</h1>
    <p>This is a full documentation of all the changes, updates, and bug fixes of the Archer Discord Bot by <br> hAck_3r64 (me!), also including every command the bot has as well as information on that specific <br> update.</p>

    <h2>V0.1.0 (Beta)</h2>
    <p>12/02/2022 <br> <br> The first version of the very early beta. <br> Its purpose, as requested by VimtoBlue#0118, was to display updates from the weekly newsletter. <br>  It seemed wasteful to me to just leave it at that so I added a bunch of variety commands for fun, <br> which probably barely kept the server on its feet.</p>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>- a!fish<br>Makes the bot say 'fish'.<br><br>- a!transrights<br>Makes the bot say 'Heck yeah üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è'.<br><br>- a!time<br>Displays the time in the format 'It is now <current_time>.'<br><br>- a!rickroll<br>Generates a link to Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.<br><br>- a!info<br>Displays the bot's purpose and information.<br><br>- a!random<br>Makes the bot say a random useless fact.<br><br>- a!swear<br>Makes the bot say 'No.'<br><br>- a!chatmode<br>Toggles 'Chatmode', which lets the bot speak and reply to messages similar to that of a normal user.</p>
     
    <h2>V0.1.1 (Beta)</h2>
    <p>14/02/2022<br><br>The first beta update.<br>Some bugs have been fixed:<br>- a!random facts not being randomised<br>- a!chatmode not toggling chatmode<br>- emojis not displaying<br>- pings not pinging<br><br>a!info has been updated to display the current version and the changelog website.<br>Three new commands have been added, too.</p>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>- a!members<br>Displays the amount of members in the server and how many are currently online.<br><br>- a!changelog<br>Another plug to the changelog website.<br><br>- a!randomvid<br>Generates a random video from my YouTube recommended (also pings me so I hope it isn't too overused).</p>
    
    <h2>V0.2.0 (beta)</h2>
    <p>17/02/2022<br><br>A massive update.<br>This update was a ground re-write of the bot's programming in order to increase bot stability, uptime, and<br>the speed that messages send. Unfortunately, some sacrifices had to be made and some commands had<br> to be removed to account for these stability updates. However, they will hopefully be added back in later<br>updates (as well as some new, fun commands!).<br>The commands removed were:<br>- a!time<br>- a!members<br>- a!randomvid<br>- a!chatmode<br>Bug fixes and changes in this update were:<br>- a!swear has been renamed to a!curse<br>- a!info has been updated to the current version and some grammatical changes have taken place<br>- Links now embed consistently</p>
    
    <h2>V0.2.1 (Beta)</h2>
    <p>18/02/2022<br><br>A nice, mini update.<br>A few bugs were fixed:<br>- Incorrect links<br>- Misspellings<br>- Messages failing to send<br>- Incorrect formatting<br>A total of five new commands have been added.</p>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>- a!quote<br>Replies with a random quote from a list of 255 quotes.<br><br>- a!qinfo<br>Shows links to sources for a!quote and links a form for changing or censoring a quote.<br><br>- a!short<br>Links a random YouTube Short from a list of 110.<br><br>- a!servers<br>Generates invite links to three different, very cool servers (The links don't expire!)<br><br>- There is also one secret command. One that I will not tell you. A command that may or may not be developed in the future...</p>
    
    <h2>V1.0.0</h2>
    <p>11/03/2022<br><br>The first version that wasn't part of the beta.<br>The bot is now permanently online!<br>Some changes were made:<br>- a!servers now generates an invite link to a random server out of a list<br>- The bot has a custom status now and is idle instead of online<br>A total of seven new commands have been added.</p>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>- a!miningaway<br>Posts all of the lyrics to 'Mine Diamonds'.<br><br>- a!egg<br>Makes the bot reply with 'egg'.<br><br>- a!bestgames<br>Shows the list of hAck_3r64's top 5 favourite games.<br><br>- a!commandslist<br>Shows a list of all* of the Archer Discord Bot's commands.<br><br>- a!ua<br>Makes the bot say '#weStandForUkraine :flag_ua:'.<br><br>- a!russellhoward<br>Links a random TikTok clip by the greatest comedian.<br><br>- a!clips<br>Links a random YouTube clip.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size:12px">*a!commandslist has a chance of not displaying all commands, results may vary.</p>
    
    <h2>V1.1.0</h2>
    <p>24/04/2022<br><br>No new commands, but the code has been entirely rewritten as asynchronous to make the bot more stable<br>and simpler to write in.<br>Changes:<br>- a!random has been renamed to a!randomfact<br>- a!qinfo now displays the correct, updated information<br>- a!bestgames has been updated<br>And if you're actually reading this, congratulations! The secret command is a!secret.</p>
    
    <h2>V1.1.1</h2>
    <p>21/04/2022<br><br>Just changed the description of a!curse in a!commandslist to do a little trolling and act as if it actually curses<br>as per request by VimtoBlue#0118 for some reason.</p>
